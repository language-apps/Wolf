# WOLF ([W]ord [O]riented [L]inguistic [F]ramework)

WOLF provides a framework for creating indigenous dictionaries. The software supports dictionaries with multiple languages and dialects, searching and sorting, import and export facilities, generation of web-pages and pdf documents, integration with the ACORNS mobile gallery applications, multimedia attachments, and IPA phonetics.

The interface has an EXCEL feel, but geared for use by linguists. We chose this design because many linguists use EXCEL, despite its limitations for creating dictionaries. Each row in a WOLF dictionary corresponds to a word. Each word, similarly contains row and column cells. A more detailed discussion and examples are provided at the [acornslinguistics](https://www.acornslinguistics.com) website.
