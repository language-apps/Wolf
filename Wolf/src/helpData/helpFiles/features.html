<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>
<p>The current WOLF release is designed to have a feel similar to EXCEL, but geared for use by linguists. We chose this design
because many linguists use EXCEL, despite its limitations for creating dictionaries. Each row in a WOLF dictionary corresponds
to a word. Each word, similarly contains row and column cells. A more detailed discussion of this is provided on the page
describing entry (<a href="enteringwords.html">entry of words.html</a>.</p>
