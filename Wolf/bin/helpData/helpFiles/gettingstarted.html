<h2 align="center">Getting started with WOLF</h2>
<p>Before entering words into your dictionary, there is only one required step. You will need to add at
least one language (or as many as you plan to incorporate into the dictionary). To add a language, click 
on the globe icon <img src="resources/language.png" width="25" height="25" valign="middle" alt="language.png">. 
This icon appears on the left of the application frame. Once clicked a dialog will appear that includes drop-down menus
and a text field as shown below.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="resources/language.jpg"></p>
<p>The first two drop-downs on the left are for selecting a font and size to be used for a language that 
you will add. The next one is for selecting the standard three character ISO language code that corresponds to
the language. Since there are approximately seven thousand living languages, the language code drop-down is quite long. 
However, you can type the ISO code (if you know it), and the drop down will jump to that section. You can also use
the scrollbar to view the one you want and click on it to select. When you click  on a language code,
the text field will fill in with a default name for the language.</p>
<p>You can change the default language name as you wish. This is especially useful if you are using MAC based .keylayout files.
In this case, make sure the name matches the name (without the extension) of the .keylayout file dropped into the Acorns/keylayougFiles folder (you 
will need to create this folder if it does not already exist). WOLF
will then automatically change the keyboard layout to accommodate text input fields using this language. It will also automatically embed
these keylayouts into Web and mobile-based dictionaries as well. Key layout files are widely available, but you can create them
using the ACORNS ELK software. APPLE has utilities to create these files as well.</p>

<p>The variant field to the right is optional. It is useful if you have multiple writing systems
(fonts) for your language. The variant code must be no more than two characters in length.</p>


<p>After the dialog information is correct, click the <i>add</i> button and you will see the language added 
to the list in the middle of the panel. You can repeat this procedure to add as many languages as you wish. 
If you make a mistake, just click on the erroneous information in the list and then alter the information displayed. 
To record the changes, click <i>modify</i>. Tou can also click on the <i>remove</i> button to delete a language. 
Be careful when removing; if the language contains words, you will lose them, and if the 
dictionary data was not saved, you will not be able to get the lost words back.</p>

<p>To exit the language dialog, click <i>confirm</i> for WOLF to record all your changes. If you click, 
<i>cancel</i> or the close frame <i>X</i> at the top, the dictionary will revert back to the state it was in 
before you ran the language dialog.</p>

<h3>Language Dependent Sorting</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="resources/customsortorder.jpg" alt="customsortorder.jpg"/></p>

<p>Some languages require sorting orders that are different from the Unicode character values of their language font. This is accomplished by using the dialog at the bottom of the language entry dialog (shown above). Simply type in the desired sorting order for your language. Don't forget to save your changes.</p>

<h2>Optional Steps</h2
<p>There are four buttons below the globe icon at the left of the application frame. These are to
respectively enter information regarding copyrights, contributing authors,configuring output formats, and manage ontology data.</p>

<table align="center" border="1">
	<tr><td>Copyright</td><td><img src="resources/copyright.png" alt="copyright.png"></td>
		<td>Clicking this icon causes a text area dialog to appear. Simply type the copyright notice
		and then click <i>confirm</i>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Author</td></td><td><img src="resources/author.png" alt="author.png"></td>
		<td>The author icon enables you to enter contacts for authors that contribute information
		to the dictionary. Each time you finish entering information about a new author,
		click <i>add</i>. This will cause the author to display among a list of those already 
		entered. Clicking on one of these authors will cause their contact information to display 
		in the text fields. You can then modify the information and click <i>modify</i> or you can click
		the <i>remove</i> button to delete an author. Clicking confirm will cause WOLF to incorporate your changes
		into the dictionary.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Templates</td><td><img src="resources/document.png" alt="ldocument.png"></td>
		<td>Users can customize how dictionaries print RTF and PDF formatted documents by creating user-defined templates.
		Please refer to <a href="templates.html">Template Definitions</a> for more details.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>Ontology</td><td><img src="resources/gold.png" alt="gold.png"></td>
		<td>WOLF uses the standard ontological terms defined in the GOLD ontology. This list was
		created through the E-meld project. If you are happy with this list, you need not use this
		dialog. However, by clicking on this dialog, you can customize the ontology for your needs.
		For example, you can enter abbreviations for ontological terms, should those provided be
		too wordy. </td>
	</tr>

<h3>Keyboard Mappings</h3>
<p>WOLF supports keyboard mappings that use <em>.keylayout</em> files, popular on MAC systems. The ELK 
		([E]xtended [L]inguistic [F]ramework) project, which is also housed on this site, can be used to create
		these files. Since these files are used on Mac systems, you can avoid the creation step by finding a prebuilt <em>keylayout</em> file appropriate for your language, on the Web. WOLF uses these files to be able to embed keyboard mappings into Web and Mobile dictionaries that it creates. That way, users don't have to worry about activating special keyboards on their local systems.</p>
		<p>
		To activate this feature, simply drop your <em>keylayout</em> files
		into the Documents/acornsFiles/keyLayoutFiles folder (or Documents/Acorns/keyLayoutFiles folder on newer installations). On applications obtained from the Apple Store, because of strict file access restrictions, Wolf uses the Downloads folder instead of Documents.</p>
