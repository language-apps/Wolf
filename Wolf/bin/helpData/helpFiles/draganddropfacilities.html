<h2 align="center">Drag and Drop Facilities</h2>
<p>The WOLF application makes use of drag and drop to implement its features. We describe this capability for incorporating
multimedia entities into dictionaries on the <a href="multimedia.html">multimedia</a> page. </p>

<p>You can also use drag and drop
to load dictionaries. Simply open the folder containing your WOLF dictionaries. The default location for WOLF files is 
the <em>Documents/Acorns</em> folder.
Press the mouse on the file that you want, 
drag over the WOLF application frame, and release. WOLF will open the dictionary. A word of caution is in order though. This
feature may not work if a dictionary is already open. In this case, click the close icon (looks like a red X)
 to close the open dictionary first. You can use drag and drop to open WOLF dictionaries that were previously saved
(these have an <em>.adct</em> extension). You can also drag and drop wolf dictionaries that were exported. These have
an <em>.xml</em> extension.</p>

<p>On Windows and MAC systems, files with <em>.adct</em> extensions are normally associated with WOLF dictionaries. You can
automatically open a WOLF dictionary and the WOLF application by clicking on these files.</p>
