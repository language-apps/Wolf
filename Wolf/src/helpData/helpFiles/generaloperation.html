<p>The WOLF application contains a main panel in the center of the frame and a series of control components around 
the north, west, and south borders. Most of the entry will be done in the center section and error messages appear 
in the south section. The control components are mostly icons that users click to cause the program to perform 
various general-purpose operations. These icons are standard across many applications so the learning curve will 
be minimal The pictures above show those icons that appear. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">General Purpose Operations</h3>
<p>The first group, on the top are respectively are for opening, closing, importing, exporting, creating a 
mobile app, making a web-site, saving, printing, or previewing. Most of these are self-explanatory. (Their use 
is very similar to that of many other programs.) For example, clicking open will bring up a file choose dialog 
where you can navigate to the dictionary file that you want. WOLF will remember the last folder you went to, 
which saves unnecessary clicks to find dictionaries to open in the future. Of course, you can avoid the open 
dialog altogether by using WOLF drag and drop facilities. The default location for WOLF dictionaries is 
Acorns within your documents folder.</p>


<h3 style="text-align:center">Creating Dictionary Web-sites and Mobile Applications</h3>
<p>To create a mobile application version, use the icon that looks like a phone. It creates a file 
with an <em>.acorns</em> extension. This file can be executed used by the Android or IOS ACORNS 
mobile application. Further documentation for installing and using these mobile programs can be 
found on the ACORNS Web-site under the ACORNS download and documentation links.</p>

<p>The icon that looks like a spider web is activated to create a dictionary-based web site. Two files
are generated. The first is the name of the dictionary with an <em>.html</em> extension. The second
is a folder with the same name, but without the extension. The latter has all of the audio, video,
and font resources needed. Click/touch on the <em>.html</em> version to bring up the web-site. These
two files can be uploaded to a tribal web-site; they can also be distributed using CDs or travel
disks.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Exporting and Importing Dictionaries</h3>
<p>A few notes are in order that pertain to export and import. When you export a file, WOLF creates an XML file 
which contains all of the dictionary text. It also creates a directory with the same name, but without 
the <em>.xml</em> extension. This directory contains all of the audio, pictures, and video incorporated into the 
dictionary using industry-standard codecs. You can access these files with other application programs that 
understand their formats. The import option recovers the dictionary. You can think of export as an best-practice 
industry-standard way to save your dictionary; it executes slower than the save option and requires more disk 
storage.</p>

<p>The import option recognizes files with either 'xml" or 'db' extensions. Those with 'xml' extensions are
created using either the WOLF export option, from EXCEL worksheets, or from SIL Lift formatted documents. Please
refer to <a href="importfromxml.html">Excel Imports</a> for more information regarding importing Excel worksheets to Wolf.
Lift formatted dictionaries are created by SIL's We Say, Lexique Pro, or Field Works applications.</p>
<p> Those files with a '.db. extension are generated by SIL's Toolbox or 
FieldWorks applications and are in MDF or SFM format. Please refer to SIL documentation (ex: the making 
dictionaries document) for more detail regarding these files. WOLF recognizes the complete set of MDF field markers
with the following clarifications. You can skip these notes if they are not applicable to your situation.
 
<ul>
<li>The mdf \pc marker is a line in the .db file with the format .G.pathName;width;height;format. Wolf recognizes 
the pathName but not the other parts of the line. The pathName can either be an absolute path or a relative
path to a file containing a picture. Valid formats have extensions, .jpg, .gif, .png, .pcx, or .bmp.</li>

<li>SFM files include the languages as part of the .db file markers. For example \d_por indicates the standard 
language code por (for the Portuguese language). If the language codes are not supplied in the .db file, WOLF 
respectively uses the codes 'ver' for Vernacular, 'eng' for English, 'nat' for National, and 'reg' for Regional. 
If these are not acceptible, you can edit the .db file to include language codes (on at least one word). 
Alternatively, after the import, you can export the imported Wolf dictionary, edit the language codes in the 
generated XML file, and then import that file back into WOLF.</li>

<li>After importing a .db file into WOLF, it is easy to select appropriate indigenous fonts. Simply click
the language icon on the left wall, select the language code, and then pick whatever installed font you want to 
use. Please refer to the <a href="gettingstarted.html">getting started</a> page for more details.</li>
<li>Reversals are handled by adding cross-reference words in the other languages in the dictionary. WOLF
can handle dictionaries with up to 100 languages and/or dialects.</li>
<li>Subentries are added to the dictionary as separate words. In FieldWorks, export using the stem-based option</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Print and Print Preview</h3>
<p>When selecting either print or print preview, make sure to first select the desired 
template controlling your output format first. The drop-down menu on the top right of the WOLF screen is used for this purpose. Please refer to  <a href="templates.html">output templates</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Dictionary Views</h3>
<table align="center"
<tr><td><img src="resources/searchandsortfacility.jpg" alt="searchandsortfacility.jpg" /></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The next group of icons on the top of the WOLF screen (shown above) are used for searching the dictionary to create different views of the words of interest.
Please refer to the <a href="searchandsort.html">search and sort page</a> for more details.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>Users can use the <img src="resources/undoredo.jpg" /> icons on the south wall of the WOLF application frame, 
all the way to the right. WOLF's undo and redo operations are on a word level. This means that you might make 
several changes to a word and undo/redo them as you wish before selecting another. Once you scroll or move away
from a word, the set of changes are finalized.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Help Facilities</h3>
<p>The help icon (<img src="resources/help.png" />) appears on the top left corner of the Wolf application frame. 
Clicking on this button brings up a help program where you can search for instruction regarding its use.</p>
